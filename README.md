# Traffic-congestion-detection
# Introduction
THis project to take inputs of traffic images and with image recognition method of YOLO to detect vehicles and count them. It basically detects objects hence detecting number of automobiles from an image of traffic and resulting detection of congestion. From the number of vehicals we can detect the traffic codition of the area.
# How to run the code:

1.First download the yolov3-320.weights from the given link in "yolov3 file download link".

2.download the cooco.names and yolov3-320.cfg.

3.Import the tracker.py file.

4.The Traffic_detection_project.py is the main code file. In it we import all the necessary file.

5.Run the Traffic_detection_project.py .Change the input from line 211 of the code.
# Expected Output

From this project we get the total count of vehical and count of different type of vehical. From the input image.
